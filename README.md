Personal Website
    I did an event planner website. We offer a few services like baby showers/bridal showers
    birthdays and weddings. We do the planning for you and we offer different prices depending 
    on the service you want. 
Technologies:
    The technologies i used will be html, .css, and bootstrap
Future Improvements:
    Work on the spacing and columns 
    Work on homepage first before doing any other page, found that to be easier to copy the nav and footer to the other pages
    Work on .css more i did struggle with that a bit
